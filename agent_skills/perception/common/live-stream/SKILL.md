name: live-stream
description: The continuous read-only recording of every camera (30 Hz) and the arm (10 Hz) over the last 10 minutes. Use before acting after any pause (thinking, writing code, waiting), to see what changed while you were not looking, and to review what happened during a motion or a script run.

# Live stream: the world keeps changing

This is the real world. Between your observations people may move or remove objects,
things settle, slide or fall, and seconds to minutes pass while you think or write code.
A frame you looked at earlier describes the past, not the present.

`runtime/stream/` (read-only) holds the last 10 minutes, continuously:

- `<camera>/<UTC minute>/<epoch_ms>.jpg`: every camera at 30 Hz (`left`, `right`, `wrist`);
  `<epoch_ms>_depth.png` once per second (uint16 millimetres, 0 = invalid).
- `robot/<UTC minute>.jsonl`: TCP pose, joints and gripper width at 10 Hz.
- `index.json`: the newest frame time per camera and the measured frame rates.

Older data is deleted as time goes by; copy what you need to keep into `output/`.

## Two ways in

- **Directly, as a tool:** `{{ robot.stream }} {seconds_ago: [0, 30, 120]}` returns the frames from
  those moments (all cameras, or `cameras: [...]`), labelled with their age, plus the arm
  state then; `{{ robot.stream }} {sheet: {seconds: 120, count: 12}}` returns one contact
  sheet per camera over the last two minutes. No motion, no arming needed.
- **As files,** for code and bulk analysis: `python -m api.stream ...` below, or read the
  images under `runtime/stream/` directly.

## When to look

- **Before any motion that follows a pause**, check that the scene still matches what
  you planned against: `{{ robot.stream }}` with `seconds_ago: [0]` (or call
  `{{ robot.observe }}`, which also saves depth for localization). If something
  moved, re-localize before moving; never act on stale positions.
- **What changed while you were away**: `{{ robot.stream }}` with a `sheet` over the time you
  were away, or `python -m api.stream changes left --seconds 300` to list the moments the
  image changed and then `{{ robot.stream }} {seconds_ago: [...]}` at those moments.
  Compare with `python -m api.stream robot --seconds 120`: changes while the arm was
  still were caused by something else (a person, a falling object).
- **After a motion or a script run**, review the frames during it (grasp slip, a
  knocked object, the moment a stack toppled) instead of guessing from the end state.
- In controllers, use `from api import stream` to check that the scene is quiet before
  committing to a grasp, and to keep evidence frames of each step.

Metric geometry still comes from `{{ robot.observe }}` frames and
`{{ robot.pixel }}` ([object-localization](../object-localization/SKILL.md)); the stream is
for timing, change and review. Look at a few selected frames or sheets, never whole
minutes of images.
